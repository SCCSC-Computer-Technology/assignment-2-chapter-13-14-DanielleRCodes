GUI for this code is clean and simple to understand what is going on. For the GUI It would if been nice if the Programming Problem 6 group box had more information instead of "Enter Minimum", and "Enter Maximum" they could have been "Enter Minimum Price", and "Enter Maximum Price". This would make it clear what we are filtering. 

The code has little documentation and would love to see more. Well using this program I noted if the description is not an exact match it will display an error. Would be nice if the user could enter partial descriptions Example "shirts" and then all products with shirts displayed. This can be done by changing one line of code instead of ## where Product. Description == userDescription ##  you can do ## where Product.Description.Contains(userDescription) this will allow the user to input partial descriptions. Overall this code is well-written and makes sure users input the correct data type without causing the program to crash.
