The interface is a neat divergence from other interfaces I've seen so far, with the user controls 
on the right side. However, I feel like the way information is displayed on the pop-up is lacking. 
The item code, stock on hand, and price are all useful information a user might be looking for.

It would also help if the description especially and possibly also the product number searches 
allow for partial entries using 'contains'. This would allow for more broad searches instead of 
only getting one possible result.

There are very few comments, making the code harder to follow than it probably needs to be. Error 
messages are also nondescriptive and could use more information to help troubleshoot.
